/*

Write a function that returns true if the given Binary Tree of size N is SumTree 
else return false. A SumTree is a Binary Tree in which value of each node x is equal 
to sum of nodes present in its left subtree and right subtree . 
An empty tree is SumTree and sum of an empty tree can be considered as 0. 
A leaf node is also considered as SumTree.

Following is an example of SumTree.

          26
        /    \
      10      3
    /   \   /   \ 
   4     6  1    2
