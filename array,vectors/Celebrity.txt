/*

The problem is to find the celebrity in a party. The celebrity is the one who 
doesn't know anyone but everyone knows him. Then why he is in the party you ask, he is there
to surprise everyone. 
So you are given an array of N*N elements where N is the number of people in the
party including the celebrity himself. 
the value of [i]][j] is set when i knows j, not necessarily the other way around.
So job is to find the celebrity whose row will be filled with 0 ,[i][i] is 0.
