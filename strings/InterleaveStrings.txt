/*

Given three strings A, B and C your task is to complete the function isInterleave
 which returns true if C is an interleaving of A and B else returns false. 
C is said to be interleaving A and B, if it contains all characters of A and B
 and order of all characters in individual strings is preserved.

Example(To be used only for expected output):
Input:
2
YX  X  XXY
XY X XXY

Output
0
1

Explanation:
1. For first test case XXY is not interleaving of YX and X
2. For the sec test case XXY is interleaving of XY and X.
